## Description

This APP was created using CRA V3 and uses [Ant design](http://ant.design) along with it.
Ant design needs a custom version [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired/) to run on top of react-scripts.

Typescript was added after project was initialized and not as part of CRA

Cypress runs just fine.
Needs proper config to run code coverage for cypress.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cypress`

Launches Cypress testing

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
